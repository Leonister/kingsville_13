What I've Done today and need to finish


So I ripped some code and icons and sound n' shit from the /tg/ station master folder,
and now we'll just need to finish up and make all of that code actually fucking work.

So you probably will see a folder called "tg-code", with everything still in it. 
**NOTHING IN THIS FOLDER WILL CHANGE**
All of the code in the tg-code folder will be modified and transferred to our normal 
code folder. Keep this in mind, else we'll have to scrounge for a backup folder every time 
one of us fucks up the code or compilation.

So in regards to what I'll be doing today, I just want to get clicking on objects working
and a working UI with plenty of verbs to use. I know I didn't do a great job getting the
required shit, so don't bitch at me for not getting everything; I don't know everything
about byond and tg-code so I don't know what's supposed to go with what.

	Cheers.

Folders are becoming unorganized, moving unused stuff to a different folder so we know
what we are using. 

Working on aditional mapping sprites, need to make more walls and doors. Also need to make dirt
path sprites function more correctly.
