What I've Done today and need to finish<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
So I ripped some code and icons and sound n' shit from the /tg/ station master folder,<br> 
and now we'll just need to finish up and make all of that code actually fucking work.<br> 
<br> 
So you probably will see a folder called "tg-code", with everything still in it.<br>  
**NOTHING IN THIS FOLDER WILL CHANGE**<br> 
All of the code in the tg-code folder will be modified and transferred to our normal<br>  
code folder. Keep this in mind, else we'll have to scrounge for a backup folder every time<br>  
one of us fucks up the code or compilation.<br> 
<br> 
So in regards to what I'll be doing today, I just want to get clicking on objects working<br> 
and a working UI with plenty of verbs to use. I know I didn't do a great job getting the<br> 
required shit, so don't bitch at me for not getting everything; I don't know everything<br> 
about byond and tg-code so I don't know what's supposed to go with what.<br> 

	Cheers.<br>

Folders are becoming unorganized, moving unused stuff to a different folder so we know<br> 
what we are using.<br>  
<br> 
Working on aditional mapping sprites, need to make more walls and doors. Also need to make dirt<br> 
path sprites function more correctly.<br>
